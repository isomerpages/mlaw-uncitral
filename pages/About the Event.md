Jointly organised by the Singapore Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), and supported by the National University of Singapore's Centre for International Law (CIL), the Sixth Intersessional Meeting of Working Group III will focus on the proposed standing multilateral mechanism and appellate mechanism for investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS).

The standing multilateral mechanism and appellate mechanism are two distinct, though overlapping, proposals. Of the range of reform elements being considered by [Working Group III](https://uncitral.un.org/en/working_groups/3/investor-state), it is these two reform elements that involve the most significant structural change to the ISDS landscape.

Working Group III delegates have had the opportunity to discuss certain aspects of these two reform elements but have not had the opportunity to discuss them fully. Working papers, initial drafts and background material on the standing multilateral mechanism may be found [here](https://uncitral.un.org/en/multilateralpermanentinvestmentcourt), and on the appellate mechanism, [here](https://uncitral.un.org/en/appellatemechanism).

This Sixth Intersessional Meeting will be an opportunity for delegates to delve deeper into the issues that will need to be considered in developing these reform options, and canvass the range of considerations and perspectives on these issues.

Interested local and international stakeholders in ISDS and dispute resolution are invited to attend the panel discussions that are open to the public, to learn more about these significant reform proposals.

Remote participation is available for UNCITRAL delegates and invited observers. Simultaneous interpretation between English and French will be provided.

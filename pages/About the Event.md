The sixth intersessional meeting of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Working Group III on investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) reforms will be held from 7 to 8 September 2023. Jointly organised by the Singapore Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and UNCITRAL, and supported by the National University of Singapore's Centre for International Law (CIL), the meeting will facilitate the exchange of views on a possible standing multilateral mechanism and appellate mechanism in ISDS.

The meeting will feature a diverse line-up of speakers from various stakeholder groups, such as government officials, legal practitioners, and academics. Topics to be discussed include: the key objectives and challenges of a standing mechanism; possible structure, scope and governance of a standing mechanism; a standing *vs.* ad hoc appellate mechanism; grounds and standard of appeal; compatibility with the existing ISDS system; and issues relating to the recognition and enforcement of decisions emanating from a standing and/or appellate mechanism.
